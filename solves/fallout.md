# FALLOUT

## WELL THIS ISN'T A TOUGH ONE ...AN IMPORTANT ONE THOUGH !!

#### Note : Before Solidity version 0.4.22, constructors and contract names were indeed allowed to be the same. This was the convention used for defining constructors in those earlier versions of Solidity

First of all - intended constructor declaration has typo, "Fal1out" instead of "Fallout". So it is just treated as a normal method not a constructor. Hence we simply call it & claim ownership.

```
await contract.Fal1out()
```

---> You can now submit the instance
